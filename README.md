🏋️ Fitness FAQ – AI-Powered Gym Discovery Chatbot
📌 Overview

Fitness FAQ is an AI-powered FAQ chatbot designed to help users discover the best-fit gyms, fitness centers, trainers, and programs based on their comfort, preferences, and goals.

The project uses rule-based NLP + Generative AI (Gemini) to provide accurate, trustworthy, and scalable fitness information.

This prototype currently demonstrates the concept using Octane Fitness Studio (Erode, Tamil Nadu) and is built as part of the 6-Week AI & GenAI Training Challenge (Challenge 2) by HPE & Intel.
